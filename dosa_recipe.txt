Take dosa batter and then spread a large spoon-ful of batter onto a hot pan. Spread a bit oil around the periphery of the dosa and wait till the sides start crumpling in indicating the the dosa is ready.  Then use a spatula to slowly fold the dosa to form a cylindrical shape and service it with sambar and chutney.
Yummy!
